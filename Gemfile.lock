Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "rack":
  In snapshot (Gemfile.lock):
    rack (= 1.4.1)

  In Gemfile:
    sinatra (>= 2.0.0) was resolved to 2.0.0, which depends on
      rack-protection (= 2.0.0) was resolved to 2.0.0, which depends on
        rack

    rack-test (>= 0.6.1) was resolved to 0.6.1, which depends on
      rack (>= 1.0)

    sinatra (>= 2.0.0) was resolved to 2.0.0, which depends on
      rack (~> 2.0)

Running `bundle update` will rebuild your snapshot from scratch, using only
the gems in your Gemfile, which may resolve the conflict.
